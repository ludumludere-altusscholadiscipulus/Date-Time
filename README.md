# Date-Time

Hello! If you're reading this, then thank you for downloading the source code of Date&Time. It's all basic math and counting stuff. I didn't work on a pure game since
college kept me busy and I was already working on two games for a research paper. Although those games are concept of proof, it was the toughest and most exhausting game
I've ever made through pure coding.

Once again, thank you for downloading this source code. Hope you can learn a thing or two from this tool I made. I'd like to also thank Mr. Tom Brinton for making the
famicase. If that famicase wasn't made, I don't think I'll ever make this. Thank you to all of those who supported me. There may be some updates in the game in the
far future, but all of that is depending on my mood whether I want to or not. If you think there is anything I can do to improve it, let me know. Wish you all the best!
